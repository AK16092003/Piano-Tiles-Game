            <li>A set of tiles in 6x6 grid would light up , the user have to memorize the position of the tiles which lights up.</li>
            
            <li>Then the user would be allowed to select the specific tiles which light up before. If the user selects all tiles correctly only in <b>same order</b> , then they would proceed to the next level.</li>
            
            <li>In each successive level , the number of tiles that light up would increase by 1. So every time , the game gets tougher !</li>

            <li>Selecting an incorrect tile or selecting in different order would lead to termination of the game ! , In order to play again , user have to restart the game .</li>
            
            <li>Each correct tile selected would give a score of 5 points , and the time taken to select them will also be counted towards ranking in leaderboard.</li>
